Pipeline to implement a spheroidal flux freezing model on a set of data

This tool is to be used in order to apply a spheriodal flux freezing model on a system of up to 3 cores. We are presently working towards making this tool into a python library that will be made public at the end of August 2023. 

While we are working hard at that we have put forward a tool which is able to do all the fitting but is rather complicated to underdstand. Please follow the instructions given in the worked example provided under the name SFF_worked_exaple.ipynb

Feel free to contact me at jessy.marin@cfa.harvard.edu for any questions regarding the scripts.
